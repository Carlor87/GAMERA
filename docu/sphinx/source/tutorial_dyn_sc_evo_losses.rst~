Level 4: Photon Spectrum, Particle Evolution, Almost Everything Variable
========================================================================

In this section we also make a lot of stuff variable in time. This include the 
B-field and the ambient density, which means that energy losses become 
time-dependent. The assumed time-dependence has no specific physical meaning.

In order to add a time-dependence in all of these parameters, the procedure
is analogue to what was done in the last level with the luminosity. 

 - We expand the luminosity function to give us additional 2D-``lists`` for 
   density, maximum electron energy, ambient density and the B-field:

  .. sourcecode:: python

    def GetSpindownStuff(tc, age, l0, b0, emax0, n0):
  
      t = np.logspace(0,math.log10(1000.*age),300)
      lumt = []
      emaxt = []
      bt = []
      nt = []
      n = 0
      for i in t:
        l = l0/math.pow(1.+i/tc,2.)
        btt = b0*math.sqrt(l/l0)*(1.+0.5*math.sin(0.1*n*3.14))
        lumtt = l*(1.+0.5*math.cos(0.1*n*3.14))
        emaxtt = emax0*math.pow(l/l0,0.25)*(1.+0.5*math.sin(0.05*n*3.14))
        ntt = n0*math.pow(l/l0,0.25)*(1.+0.5*math.cos(0.05*n*3.14))
    
        bt.append([])
        bt[n].append(i)
        bt[n].append(btt)
        lumt.append([])
        lumt[n].append(i)
        lumt[n].append(lumtt)
        emaxt.append([])
        emaxt[n].append(i)
        emaxt[n].append(emaxtt)
        nt.append([])
        nt[n].append(i)
        nt[n].append(ntt)
    
        n = n+1
      return lumt,bt,emaxt,nt

 - usage of these parameter evolution works as follows:

  .. sourcecode:: python
  
    fp.SetLuminosityLookup(lumt)
    fp.SetBFieldLookup(bt)
    fp.SetEmaxLookup(emaxt)
    fp.SetAmbientDensityLookup(denst)

  .. note:: 
    
    Particle evolution with time-dependent losses is in general not possible 
    with analytic or semi-analytic methods. 
    Using parameter evolutions that result in time-dependent energy losses
    thus internally call a grid-solving algorithm, whose calculation speed 
    depends on the physics of the system. The grid solver is slow if time
    steps are small. Those are given by 

    .. math:: 

      \Delta t \approx \Delta E (E) / \dot E (E)

    Therefore, the calculation can take a long time, if
    
     - energy losses are high

     - the number of spectrum bins is large

    Furthermore, currently protons are considered to only lose energy by adiabatic
    losses (i.e. not due to p-p collisions), and only if an expansion speed is given. 
    As these losses are normally relatively low compared to typical electron 
    losses, speed problems normally are not an issue for the evolution calculation
    of protons. 

  .. note:: 
    
    If the computation is slow, there are several ways to compromise.

     - **Reduce the number of energy bins**

     - **Use the** ``SetCriticalMinEnergyForGridSolver`` **Particle class method:**

       The grid solver automatically determines the starting time of the 
       iteration ``tmin``. Particles injected before ``tmin`` are treated as 
       being injected as a single blob.
       This blob of particles will slide down in energy over time and end up
       at some energy ``E`` after ``t=age``. Now, the grid solver automatically 
       choses ``tmin``
       as the starting time so that the blob ends up at a desired energy ``Ed`` after
       ``t=age``. The default is ``Ed=1.e-3 erg``, but you can set a manual 
       value like ``fp.SetCriticalMinEnergyForGridSolver(1.e-2)`` which would 
       set ``Ed=1.e-2 erg``. As a result, ``tmin`` becomes larger, and in systems
       where the B-field decreases with time, your electron energy losses at the beginning of 
       the evolution are smaller which in turn increases the computational speed.
       The same effect is achievable by setting a high value of Emin, e.g.
       ``fp.SetEmin(1.e-2)``. Choose this options when you can live with this
       bump - this is typically true when you are only interested in VHE
       emission and even a high bump in electrons doesn't matter as you are looking
       at the emission from TeV particles.

     - **Appoximate with constant losses**

       If the time-changes in the loss-governing parameters (i.e. B-field, 
       ambient density, source radius and extension speed) are slow, you could
       approximate with a model where these values are static. In other words,
       approximate with something like the model you got to know in level 3.




 - for the following plots, we set two additional parameters:

  .. sourcecode:: python
    
    fp.SetBreakEnergy(ebreak)
    fp.SetLowSpectralIndex(spindlow)

 .. hint::
    
    Since power-law and broken power-law particle distributions are the most 
    common in high energy astrophysics, those two models are pre-available in
    ``GAMERA`` and can be used by setting luminosity, minimal energy, maximal
    energy and the spectral indices and break energies (as shown in all the 
    previous examples). If you want to use different shapes of the particle 
    injection spectrum, you can provide this with the 
    ``SetCustomInjectionSpectrum`` or ``SetCustomInjectionSpectrumLookup`` 
    methods. The former specifies a custom injection spectrum that is constant over
    time (2D ``list`` or ``vector``), whereas the latter allows for a injection
    spectrum that is time-dependent (input 3D ``list`` or ``vector``). If these 
    methods are used, the luminosity and energy boundaries are fixed by the 
    input spectrum and do not have to be specified via `Set` functions.
