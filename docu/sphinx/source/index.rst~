   contain the root `toctree` directive.

is a new open-source C++/python package which handles the spectral modelling of 
non-thermally emitting astrophysical sources in a simple and modular way. 
It allows the user to devise time-dependent models of leptonic and hadronic 
particle populations in a general astrophysical context (including SNRs, PWNs 
and AGNs) and to compute their subsequent photon emission. Moreover, this 
package also contains the necessary tools to create Monte-Carlo population 
synthesis models.

.. warning::

   I am currently removing all ROOT dependencies. 
   The Dynamics, Galaxy and InstrumentResponse classes will land
   in this repo in the near future.
